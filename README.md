# Titanic-Dataset-Project
This project was part of the course "Introduction to machine learning and data mining" taught at DTU (Technical University of Denmark), Copenhagen.
<br /> The course description can be found here: https://kurser.dtu.dk/course/2019-2020/02450.

## Description
Everyone (that hasn’t been living under a rock) has seen James Cameron’s 1997 block- buster ”Titanic”, starring the young and handsome Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet. Although most people are only interested in the dramatic aspect of ”modern history’s dead- liest peacetime commercial marine disaster”, we are mainly interested in finding underlying patterns in the survivability of the different groups of passengers and predicting whether a certain person would have been more likely to survive or die.

We used the Titanic dataset from Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/overview.

In this project, we discuss a variety of problems:
* Part 1: Discusses the relevant attributes of the dataset, it lists the issues of the dataset and how it was cleaned up. Next, a PCA is applied and the statistics of the dataset are summarized using tables and different visual techniques. 
* Part 2: Discusses a relevant regression and classification problem related to the dataset. The classification problem is as follows: "Given the attributes of one passenger, determine whether they were more likely to survive or die." The regression problem is: "Predict the fare of a certain passenger based on known relevant attribute values."
* Part 3: In the final part; we apply Clustering, Anomaly Detection and Association mining to our Titanic dataset.

The papers listed below discuss each part of the project in-depth.
